# Technical Architecture

This is a technical architecture for a domain-specialized Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored to a 3rd party's internal knowledge base (e.g., for a financial services firm specializing in asset management). This system will serve as a chatbot service, enabling employees to query company policies, extract statistics, and get accurate summaries via a conversational interface. The architecture builds directly on the provided conceptual design, with enhancements for robustness, scalability, and domain specificity.

To "think harder," I've enriched the design with practical technologies, focusing on Phase 1 by integrating advanced document processing tools like Docling (an open-source PDF conversion library from IBM that excels in layout analysis, table extraction, and OCR). This upgrades data acquisition by improving accuracy in handling complex documents like policy PDFs with tables and images. I've also upgraded other phases with specific tech stacks, such as hybrid retrieval mechanisms, fine-tuned models, and monitoring tools, while ensuring the system is deployable on cloud infrastructure.

The architecture assumes a moderate-scale deployment (e.g., 10,000+ documents, 100+ users) and emphasizes cost-efficiency using open-source components where possible. I'll describe the phases sequentially, including data flows, tech selections, and implementation notes.

## Phase 1: Data Acquisition and Preprocessing (Enriched with Advanced Tech)

This phase is upgraded to handle unstructured and semi-structured data more intelligently, reducing preprocessing errors and enriching metadata. By incorporating Docling, we improve extraction from PDFs (common in policies and reports) with high-fidelity layout preservation, table parsing, and OCR for scanned docs. Additional techs like Apache Tika for multi-format ingestion and spaCy for NLP-based cleaning ensure high-quality data ingestion.

1. **Identify Data Sources**:
    - **Internal Documents**: Policy manuals (e.g., HR policies in PDF), annual reports, financial statements (Excel/PDF), meeting minutes (DOCX), research papers, internal wikis (Confluence exports as HTML/JSON), customer service logs (from Zendesk exports), product specifications.
    - **External Documents**: Industry reports (e.g., from Gartner via API), regulatory docs (e.g., SEC filings scraped from EDGAR), competitor analysis (news APIs like NewsAPI), relevant news articles (filtered for domain relevance).
    - **Structured Data**: SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL for sales data), NoSQL (MongoDB for logs), data warehouses (Snowflake), spreadsheets (Google Sheets/Excel exports).
    - **Upgrade**: Use metadata scanning to auto-categorize sources (e.g., via ML classifiers in scikit-learn) for domain filtering, ensuring only finance-related docs are ingested.
2. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**:
    - **Connectors**: Apache Tika for unified parsing of PDF, DOCX, HTML, JSON, CSV. Database connectors via SQLAlchemy for SQL/NoSQL, and PyODBC for legacy systems.
    - **Crawlers/Scrapers**: Scrapy for web-based sources (e.g., internal wiki crawling with authentication). For external, use Selenium for dynamic sites if needed, but prioritize APIs to avoid legal issues.
    - **APIs**: Integrate with enterprise systems like SharePoint API, Confluence API, or Salesforce API for real-time pulls.
    - **Upgrade**: Implement an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow for scheduling and orchestration. This ensures incremental updates (e.g., daily crawls) and handles failures gracefully.
3. **Preprocessing and Cleaning**:
    - **Text Extraction**: Use Docling for advanced PDF handling—it performs OCR (via Tesseract integration), extracts text while preserving layout, and converts pages to markdown with embedded tables/images. For non-PDFs, fall back to pdfplumber or PyMuPDF.
    - **Noise Reduction**: Regex-based removal of headers/footers (e.g., using Python's re module). ML-based boilerplate detection with libraries like BoilerPy3.
    - **Normalization**: spaCy for typo correction, lemmatization, and entity recognition (e.g., normalizing dates to ISO format).
    - **Structural Understanding**: Docling's core strength— it identifies sections, headings, tables (as pandas DataFrames), and figures (extracted as images with captions). For tables, convert to CSV strings; for figures, use ALT text generation via CLIP (OpenAI's vision model).
    - **Metadata Extraction**: Use Docling to pull embedded metadata (e.g., author, date). Augment with NLP: Extract keywords via KeyBERT, departments via named entity recognition (NER) in Hugging Face Transformers.
    - **Upgrade**: Add data quality checks with Great Expectations (open-source) to validate cleanliness (e.g., no empty chunks). For multimodal data, embed images/charts using Vision Transformers (ViT) for later retrieval.

**Data Flow**: Sources → Airflow DAG → Tika/Docling Ingestion → spaCy Cleaning → Metadata Enrichment → Stored in S3-compatible bucket (e.g., MinIO for on-prem).

## Phase 2: Indexing and Retrieval (The "R" in RAG)

Focus on hybrid retrieval for accuracy in domain queries (e.g., exact policy terms + semantic context). Tech selections prioritize open-source for cost.

1. **Chunking Strategy**:
    - **Policy Documents**: Semantic chunking using LlamaIndex's SentenceSplitter, respecting sections (via Docling's structure). Overlap by 20% for context. Chunk size: 512-1024 tokens.
    - **Statistical Data**: Paragraph-level for text; table rows as individual chunks with headers preserved.
    - **Table Handling**: Serialize tables as markdown or JSON; embed as a whole if small, or per-row for large ones.
    - **Upgrade**: Use recursive chunking with LangChain to handle hierarchies (e.g., policy > section > paragraph).
2. **Embedding Model Selection**:
    - **Domain-Specific Fine-tuning**: Start with Sentence-Transformers (e.g., Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base) and fine-tune on company data using Hugging Face's Trainer API. Dataset: Pairs of queries and relevant chunks from internal docs.
    - **Considerations**: Model size ~100MB for low latency; use ONNX for inference speedup.
    - **Multimodal Embeddings**: CLIP or BLIP for text+image embeddings if charts are key (e.g., sales graphs).
    - **Upgrade**: Ensemble embeddings (text + metadata) for better relevance.
3. **Vector Database**:
    - **Selection**: Weaviate (open-source, supports hybrid search and metadata filtering).
    - **Indexing**: Store embeddings with metadata (e.g., doc_type: "policy", date: "2023-01-01").
    - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes pods; handle 1M+ vectors.
4. **Retrieval Mechanism**:
    - **Semantic Search**: Cosine similarity in Weaviate; top-K=10.
    - **Keyword Search**: Integrate BM25 via Elasticsearch (hybrid with Weaviate using Haystack framework).
    - **Metadata Filtering**: Pre-filter in Weaviate queries (e.g., where doc_type="financial" and date > "2023").
    - **Re-ranking**: Use a cross-encoder (e.g., ms-marco-MiniLM) from Sentence-Transformers to re-score top-K.
    - **Upgrade**: Add query classification (e.g., via zero-shot with BART) to route to keyword vs. semantic.

**Data Flow**: Preprocessed chunks → Embedding Model → Weaviate Index → Query Embedding → Hybrid Retrieve → Re-rank.

## Phase 3: Generation (The "G" in RAG)

Leverage open-source LLMs for cost; integrate as a chatbot via Streamlit or FastAPI.

1. **Large Language Model (LLM) Selection**:
    - **Domain-Specific Adaptation**: Fine-tune Mistral-7B (open-source) on company data using PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) for low cost.
    - **Prompt Engineering**: Use few-shot examples in prompts. E.g., for summarization: "Context: {chunks}\nSummarize the expense policy focusing on key rules."
    - **Context Window Management**: Truncate/summarize chunks with a smaller LLM (e.g., Phi-2) if exceeding 8K tokens.
2. **Generation Pipeline**:
    - **Query Expansion**: Use LLM to generate synonyms (e.g., "sales" → "revenue, figures").
    - **Retrieve**: As above.
    - **Contextualize**: Prompt template: "Query: {query}\nRelevant Docs: {chunks}\nAnswer accurately without hallucinating."
    - **Generate**: Mistral inference via vLLM for speed.
    - **Upgrade**: For chatbots, maintain session state with Redis for multi-turn conversations.

**Data Flow**: User Query (via API) → Expansion → Retrieve → Prompt → LLM → Response.

## Phase 4: Evaluation and Refinement

1. **Metrics**:
    - **Retrieval**: Precision@K, Recall@K, NDCG via Ragas library.
    - **Generation**: Factuality via LLM-as-judge (e.g., GPT-4 eval), ROUGE, hallucination detection with SelfCheckGPT.
    - **Latency**: Monitor with Prometheus.
2. **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)**:
    - **Feedback**: Thumbs up/down in chatbot UI; log to PostgreSQL.
    - **Annotation**: Use LabelStudio for curating feedback datasets.
    - **RLHF**: Apply via TRL library on Mistral.
3. **Monitoring**:
    - Tools: Grafana + Prometheus for dashboards; alert on drift with Evidently AI.

**Upgrade**: Automated A/B testing for model versions.

## Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance

1. **Scalable Infrastructure**: AWS EKS (Kubernetes) for orchestration; EC2 for compute, S3 for storage. Serverless options: Lambda for ingestion.
2. **API/Integration Layer**: FastAPI for REST endpoints; integrate with Slack/Teams for chatbot.
3. **Security**: OAuth2 for access; encrypt with AWS KMS; audit logs.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Airflow for retraining schedules; GitOps with ArgoCD for updates.

**Example Scenarios**: As in conceptual, but with tech: Query → Weaviate Retrieve → Mistral Generate.

This architecture is practical, deployable in 3-6 months, and upgradeable. Total estimated cost: $5K/month on AWS for mid-scale. For implementation, start with a PoC on 100 docs.
